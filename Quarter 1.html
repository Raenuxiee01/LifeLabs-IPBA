<li>Lifestyle</li>
<p>- Lifestyle content will be able to educate and inform our audience about many types of lifestyles. This podcast will aim to raise awareness of the various lifestyles that people may encounter.

<h2>What is a Podcast?</h2>
<p>A podcast is a digital audio program made up of audio episodes that may be downloaded or streamed via the internet. It functions similarly to a radio show, but with one significant difference: you can subscribe to a podcast and listen to it whenever you want.</p>
